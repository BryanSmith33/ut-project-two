# Utah Teachers Project Two

Today we are going to create a basic web page that has a common structure seen in a lot of websites. There isn't any functionality just yet, but we are build off what we learn in a future lesson

* Open your text editor and create a new file called `index.html`
* Create a new file called `style.css`
* Set up the basic scaffolding for an HTML document
* Inside of the `<head>` tag, create a `<link>` tag that will reference the style.css file
* Create a new `nav` element with a class of navbar
* Inside of `nav`, create a `span` element with a class of my-name
* Create a unordered list that is a sibling to the previously created span. Give it a class called nav-links
* Create three items inside of the unordered list: Home, About, Contact
* Create a new section with the `section` element. Give it a class of hero
* Create a `div` inside of hero with a class of quote. Enter an inspirational quote between the div
* Outside of the hero section, create a new section with a class of qualities
* Create three divs inside, each with a class called quality and then another class called one, two and three that are on the respective div.
* Outside of of the qualities section, create a new section with the `footer` element. Give it a class of footer
* Inside of the footer, create a div with a class of profile-img.
* Inside of profile-img, create an image element. The img element should have a src and a n alt prop. src tells where to find the image and alt is for screen readers to let users know what the image is.
* Outside of profile-img, create a new div with a class of about-me.
* Inside of about-me, create a p tag with the text "Thanks for visiting my site! Feel free to reach me at me@imbryan.com"
* Create an a tag that wraps the email so you can click it and send an email.
